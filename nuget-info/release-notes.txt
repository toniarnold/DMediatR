* Implemented custom X509 certificate validation (renewal is still not functional)

* New ILock with the HasLocked SemaphoreSlim collection avoids deadlocks with recursive messages that require locking shared resources

* New SerializedInterface<T> for de- resp. rehydration when serializing objects with non-serializable members like above SemaphoreSlim

* Added DMediatRNode1.Test project to the DMediatRNodeTemplate with integration tests using one and two gRPC node processes
