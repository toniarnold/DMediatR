* Linux compatibility (e.g. RuntimeIdentifier linux-arm64)

* Iot sample node that responds to DMediatR requests with its CPU temperature when deployed on a Raspberry Pi

* PerformanceMeter NUnit tests to measure gRPC throughput

* Grpc:MaxMessageSize option to increase the defaults

* Grpc:ResponseCompressionAlgorithm/ResponseCompressionLevel/MessagePackCompression options to enable gzip or lz4

* The inexplicably required development certificates are not handled by DMediatR
